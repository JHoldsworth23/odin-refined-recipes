                    Sweetroll is a delicious pastry with a light brown sweetbread as the lower part, with 
                    icing covering the top. Sweetrolls are a food item found in <em class="white-bg">Skyrim</em>, which is the
                    one of greatest games I have ever played.

                <ol class="list white-bg">
                    <li class="left-align white-bg">
                        Into a large mixing bowl combine 3 tablespoons of melted butter,
                        1 cup of warm whole milk, 2 tablespoons of honey, 2 teaspoons of 
                        active dry yeast, and 1 large egg then whisk together with a pinch
                        of salt. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="left-align white-bg">
                        Add together with 2 cups of all-purpose flour and mix together until
                        a smooth batter is formed.
                    </li>
                    <li class="left-align white-bg">
                        Generously butter the tube cans and spoon the batter inside. Make sure
                        to wipe up any sticky excess. Cover with plastic wrap and rest at room 
                        temperature for 30 minutes during which the batter should expand double.
                    </li>
                    <li class="left-align white-bg">
                        Remove the plastic wrap and place the cakes onto a rimmed baking sheet and 
                        place into a preheated 180Â°C oven for 15 minutes or until lightly brown and
                        a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
                    </li>
                    <li class="left-align white-bg">
                        After letting the cakes cool in the pan for about 5 minutes, remove the 
                        cakes from the tube cans and let them completely cool on a wire rack. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="left-align white-bg">
                        In which time the frosting can be made by mixing together 200 grams of 
                        confectioner's sugar with 45 grams of low-fat milk and whisking together 
                        until smooth.</li>
                    <li class="left-align white-bg">
                        At which point, generously spoon the frosting on top of the cake and enjoy it.
