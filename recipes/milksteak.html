                    Milksteak is Charlie Kelly's favourite food in <em class="white-bg">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em>. It was first 
                    mentioned in the Season 5 episode "<a class="episode-link white-bg" href="https://itsalwayssunny.fandom.com/wiki/The_Waitress_Is_Getting_Married" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Waitress is Getting Married</a>"

                    <li class="left-align white-bg">
                        Boil two cups of milk in a saucepan before dropping a steak into 
                        the boiling milk until pallid and misshapen.
                    </li>
                    <li class="left-align white-bg">
                        Remove steak from the milk once it looks like it's maybe a disgusting deformed steak(?)...
                    </li>
                    <li class="left-align white-bg">
                        Before digging in, add a few handfuls of jellybeans as a garnish.
                    </li>
                    <li class="left-align white-bg">
                        Serve and enjoy this atrocious dish! Pray for your health...
